        <h1>AWS Compute Services</h1>

        <h2>AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. You can launch virtual servers, known as
            instances, and choose from a variety of instance types based on your application's requirements. EC2
            instances can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple web servers to complex machine learning
            workloads.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
        <p>
            AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing
            servers. You can upload your code, and Lambda automatically scales and executes it in response to
            incoming requests or events. Lambda is well-suited for event-driven architectures and microservices.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon EBS provides scalable block storage volumes that you can attach to EC2 instances. These volumes
            can be used as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, or as additional storage for
            applications and databases. EBS volumes persist independently from the life of an EC2 instance.
