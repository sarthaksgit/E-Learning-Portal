        <h1>Fundamentals of Pricing in the Cloud</h1>
        <p>
            Cloud pricing involves paying for the computing resources and services you consume. It typically
            follows a pay-as-you-go model, where you pay for what you use without upfront costs or long-term commitments.
        </p>

        <h2>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</h2>
        <p>
            TCO is the total cost of owning and operating IT assets over their lifespan. In the cloud, TCO includes
            not only the direct costs of resources but also factors like personnel, maintenance, and operational
            expenses. Cloud services can often provide a lower TCO compared to traditional on-premises solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Billing and Cost Management</h2>
        <p>
            AWS provides tools for monitoring, managing, and optimizing costs. AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and
            AWS Trusted Advisor are among the services that help you understand and control your AWS spending. It's
            essential to set up budgets, monitor usage, and leverage cost optimization best practices.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Technical Support</h2>
        <p>
            AWS offers various support plans to meet different needs, including Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise
            support plans. AWS Support provides access to Cloud Support Engineers 24/7, documentation, and tools for
            resolving issues. Additionally, AWS Trusted Advisor helps optimize your environment for cost, security, and
            performance.
