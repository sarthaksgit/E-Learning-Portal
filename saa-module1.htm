<h1><u>Overview of Cloud Concepts</u></h1><br>
        <h2>On-Premise Data Center and AWS Cloud Computing</h2>

        <h2>On-Premise Data Center</h2>
        <p>
            An on-premise data center is a physical facility that organizations use to house their computing infrastructure,
            including servers, storage, networking equipment, and other components. It is maintained and managed by the
            organization's IT staff within their own premises.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage,
            databases, networking, software) over the internet (the cloud) instead of relying on their own local hardware and
            software.
        </p>

        <h2>Cloud Computing Offerings - Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud computing offers different deployment models, including public cloud (resources shared among multiple
            customers), private cloud (dedicated resources for a single organization), and hybrid cloud (a combination of
            both public and private clouds).
        </p>

        <h2>AWS as the Public Cloud IaaS Leader</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading public cloud platform offering a wide range of infrastructure as a service
            (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) solutions. AWS provides scalable and
            cost-effective cloud computing solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Global Infrastructure - Regions and Availability Zones</h2>
        <p>
            AWS operates in multiple geographic regions around the world. Each region consists of multiple availability zones
            (data centers) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. This global infrastructure enables users to deploy
            applications closer to end-users for improved performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon EC2 is a core AWS service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch
            and manage virtual servers (instances) on-demand, enabling scalability and flexibility in hosting applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Create your first EC2 instance</h2>
        <p>
            Learn how to create an EC2 instance in AWS, the foundational step to host applications and services in the cloud.
        </p>

        <h2>VPC Components - Implied Router and Route Tables</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. Explore VPC components such
            as the implied router and route tables, which control the traffic between subnets.
        </p>

        <h2>Configuring VPC</h2>
        <p>
            Understand the steps to configure a VPC, including defining IP address ranges, setting up subnets, and configuring
            routing tables.
        </p>

        <h2>IP Addressing - Internet Gateway - Subnet Types</h2>
        <p>
            Dive into IP addressing within VPCs, the role of internet gateways for external connectivity, and the different
            types of subnets for organizing resources.
        </p>

        <h2>VPC - Network ACLs and Security Groups</h2>
        <p>
            Explore the security aspects of VPC, including Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) for subnet-level security
            and Security Groups for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
        </p>

        <h2>Configuring Security Groups and NACL</h2>
        <p>
            Learn how to configure Security Groups and Network ACLs to enhance the security of your VPC and protect your
            resources from unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h2>VPC Security Scenarios - Applying Security Group and NACLs</h2>
        <p>
            Understand various security scenarios and best practices for applying Security Groups and Network ACLs to meet
            specific security requirements within your VPC.
        </p>

        <h2>VPC - Network Address Translation â€“ NAT</h2>
        <p>
            Explore Network Address Translation (NAT) in VPC, which allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound
            traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic initiated by external sources.
