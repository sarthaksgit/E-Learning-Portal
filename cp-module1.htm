        <h1>Introduction to Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>
            Cloud computing is a paradigm that enables on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources
            over the internet. These resources include computing power, storage, and various services, and they
            can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Cost Efficiency:** Cloud computing eliminates the need for organizations to invest in
                and maintain expensive infrastructure. Users pay only for the resources they consume.</li>
            <li>**Scalability:** Cloud services can easily scale up or down based on the demand,
                allowing organizations to adapt to changing workloads.</li>
            <li>**Flexibility:** Cloud computing provides flexibility for users to choose the programming
                language, tools, and frameworks that best meet their requirements.</li>
            <li>**Reliability:** Cloud providers offer high levels of reliability and uptime through
                redundancy and failover mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and evolving cloud computing platform provided by
            Amazon. It offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, databases,
            machine learning, analytics, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            AWS allows businesses to build and run applications without the need for upfront investment
            in physical hardware. With a pay-as-you-go pricing model, users can scale resources as needed,
            making it suitable for startups, enterprises, and everything in between.
