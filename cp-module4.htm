        <h1>AWS Security Essentials</h1>

        <h2>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
        <p>
            AWS IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It allows you to create and
            manage AWS users and groups, assign permissions, and use features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
            for an extra layer of security.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Network Security</h2>
        <p>
            AWS provides a range of services to enhance network security within your cloud environment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Amazon VPC:** Create isolated virtual networks for your resources.</li>
            <li>**Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.</li>
            <li>**NACLs (Network Access Control Lists):** Stateless rules controlling traffic at the subnet level.</li>
            <li>**AWS VPN and Direct Connect:** Secure connections between on-premises data centers and AWS.</li>
            <li>**Amazon GuardDuty:** A threat detection service for identifying malicious activity.</li>
            <li>**VPC Flow Logs:** Capture information about IP traffic for security analysis.</li>
            <li>**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets.</li>
            <li>**PrivateLink:** Access services over a private connection, avoiding exposure to the public internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Encryption</h2>
        <p>
            AWS provides robust encryption mechanisms for data in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS for secure communication,
            and leverage services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys. Encrypt sensitive data
            using industry-standard algorithms and practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Logging and Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
            Centralized logging and monitoring are critical for identifying and responding to security incidents.
            AWS CloudTrail captures API calls, providing an audit trail for actions taken within your account.
            Amazon CloudWatch allows you to collect and visualize logs and metrics, enabling proactive monitoring
            of your resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Infrastructure Security</h2>
        <p>
            Secure your infrastructure by implementing principles of least privilege, regularly updating and patching
            systems, and utilizing AWS security services like AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for protecting
            web applications. AWS Inspector can help you identify vulnerabilities in your EC2 instances.
