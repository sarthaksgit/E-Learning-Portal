        <h1>AWS Networking Basics</h1>

        <h2>Networking Basics</h2>
        <p>
            Networking is a fundamental component of cloud computing. It involves the communication of data between
            various components, systems, and services. Understanding networking basics is crucial for designing and
            implementing secure and efficient cloud architectures.
        </p>

        <h2>Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon VPC allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS
            resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides control over your virtual networking environment,
            including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and security settings.
        </p>

        <h2>VPC Networking</h2>
        <p>
            In a VPC, you can create multiple subnets, each in a different Availability Zone, to ensure high availability
            and fault tolerance. Subnets are connected by route tables, and network traffic can be controlled using
            Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).
        </p>

        <h2>VPC Security</h2>
        <p>
            VPC security is a critical aspect of AWS networking. Security Groups act as firewalls for instances,
            controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Network ACLs provide an additional layer of control at the subnet
            level. VPC Peering allows secure communication between VPCs, and VPN connections provide secure connections
            to on-premises networks.
