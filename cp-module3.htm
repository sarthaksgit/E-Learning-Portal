        <h1>AWS Global Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a robust global infrastructure that enables customers to deploy
            applications and services around the world. This infrastructure is designed for high availability,
            fault tolerance, and low-latency performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Regions</h2>
        <p>
            AWS is organized into geographical regions, each consisting of multiple data centers known as Availability Zones.
            Currently, AWS has regions in North America, South America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.
            Each region is designed to be isolated from the others to provide fault tolerance.
        </p>

        <h2>Availability Zones</h2>
        <p>
            Availability Zones (AZs) are data centers within a region that are isolated from each other. They are connected
            through low-latency links. Deploying applications across multiple AZs enhances fault tolerance and
            ensures high availability.
        </p>

        <h2>Edge Locations</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to regions and Availability Zones, AWS has a network of Edge Locations. These locations are used by
            the AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN), Amazon CloudFront, to cache and deliver content to end users with low latency.
            Edge Locations are strategically positioned to provide efficient content delivery globally.
        </p>

        <h2>Services and Compliance</h2>
        <p>
            AWS services are available globally, but not all services are present in every region. Customers can choose the
            region for their resources based on factors such as data residency requirements and service availability.
            AWS adheres to various compliance standards to ensure the security and privacy of customer data.
