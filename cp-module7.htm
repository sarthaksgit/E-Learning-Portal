        <h2>AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)</h2>
        <p>
            Amazon EBS provides scalable block storage volumes that you can attach to EC2 instances. These volumes
            are highly available and reliable, and you can choose from different volume types based on your specific
            use case. EBS volumes persist independently from the life of an EC2 instance, making them suitable for
            data that requires durability and persistence.
        </p>
